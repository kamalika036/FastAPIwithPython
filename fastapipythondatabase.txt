FastAPI  with DATABASE

 to implement dbms connectivity and also to implement ORM we must be 
having SQLAlchemy which is a ORM library to convert objects to
database.

SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that 
gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence 
patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access,
 adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.

to implement CRUD operation RDBMS we need to create the folowing python files
1. db.py(this will maintain database connection)
2. models.py(it will contain the class structure targeted for the ORM and 
also the table name to be created by a special variable __tableName__. 
variable name is fixed)
3. main.py(which will execute the application)

in main.py we have a funcytion by the name get_db() which will return the  database
connection
now we will creayte the model class.
we have defined the friend class targeted for ORM. now for main.py we need to create the
database tables. whenever my application start up or reloaded 


now wev will create a seperate database operation python file crud.py which will contain
only the crud operation related functions

we have added create_friend() to be called by main.py using fastapi so that it becom a 
rest endpoint to be accessed by any client
